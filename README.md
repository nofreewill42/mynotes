# Project Title: Notes and Connections Visualization

## Description
This project is a web-based visualization tool that uses Flask as the backend and Vis.js for the frontend. It allows users to dynamically create, edit, and visualize notes and their connections in a network graph. Users can add, edit, and connect notes interactively, and changes can be saved and managed using git for version control.

## Features
- **Create, Edit, and Delete Notes:** Users can add new notes, update existing ones, and delete them.
- **Manage Connections:** Users can create connections between notes, edit existing connections, and view them graphically.
- **Data Persistence:** Changes are saved in JSON format, and the application supports loading and saving this data.
- **Version Control:** Changes can be committed to a git repository directly from the application.

- Python 3.8 or higher
